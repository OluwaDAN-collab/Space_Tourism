So, you want to travel to
Space
Let’s face it; if you want to go to space, you might as well genuinely go to
outer space and not hover kind of on the edge of it. Well sit back, and relax
because we’ll give you a truly out of this world experience!

A launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket-propelled vehicle
used to carry a payload from Earth's surface to space, usually
to Earth orbit or beyond. Our WEB-X carrier rocket is the most
powerful in operation. Standing 150 metres tall, it's quite an
awe-inspiring sight on the launch pad!
A spaceport or cosmodrome is a site for launching (or receiving)
spacecraft, by analogy to the seaport for ships or airport for
aircraft. Based in the famous Cape Canaveral, our spaceport is
ideally situated to take advantage of the Earth's rotation for
launch.
